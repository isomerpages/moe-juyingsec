#### **Vision**
Every JYian An Artist Within

#### **Mission**
Developing Creative, Appreciative and Passionate Learners through Aesthetics

#### **Overview**
In our Juying Secondary Aesthetics Department, we believe that at the heart of every JYian is an Artist. Our Total Arts Curriculum (TAC) is designed to nurture and polish the artist in our students. The school's TAC takes the 5Es approach to Engage, Excite, Explore, Enrich and Empower all students. The TAC has a robust, holistic and tiered structure that engages our students at multiple levels. Our Tier 1 broad-based Arts education caters to all students. It comprises the Art and Music curriculum and showcases, Aesthetics assemblies and learning journeys, as well as PASSION Arts month and JYians Got Talent festival. We also have more targeted and deeper Tier 2 Arts training for interested students and enhanced exposure for selected students who have the talent and passion to pursue the Arts further, through our Visual and Performing Art CCAs, PASSION Arts modules and VIA projects, Polytechnic Advanced Elective Modules, as well as external Talent Development Programmer and industry attachments with Arts organisations. Some of our key Aesthetics Partnerships Programmes include the Lions International Peace Poster Contest, Singapore Organ Transplant Unit Live On Design Competition and One Heart for Singapore x National Day Parade Exhibition. We strive to create an authentic, values-driven, student-centred and inquiry-based aesthetics education in our classrooms; to allow our JYians to experience the joy of learning art and see the meaningfulness of the art discipline. Through the 4-5 years of Arts education in Juying, we develop essential learning dispositions in all our JYians - to become creative, appreciative and passionate learners through the inculcation of the Arts.
