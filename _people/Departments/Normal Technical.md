#### **Overview**
**Secondary 1**<br>
Secondary 1 students are taught useful skills in the NT Programme lessons like presentation skills, 3D modelling, photo-editing and introduction to programming skills.&nbsp;  

**Secondary 2**<br>
Secondary 2 students are introduced to script writing, storyboarding, videography and video-editing in the first semester under the NT programme lessons.

Students attend Advanced Elective Modules (AEM) during ITE visits where they experience first-hand courses and life at ITE. Our Secondary 2 students would opt for Aeronautics Engineering Elective Module. Here, students experience making and flying gliders, drones, first-hand experience of a flight simulator, learning journeys and learn more about the career prospects related to the industry.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

**Secondary 3 and 4**<br>
The Secondary 3 students are allocated to sign up for “Category A” Elective Module (EM) which is jointly organised by the ITEs. Students normally opt for the Videography module and Mobile Robotics module where they spend four days at the ITE, mostly involving hands-on activities.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

The Secondary 4 students would normally opt for Games Programming and Automotive Engineering Elective Module (EM). Here, students experience Go Karting, Motion Driving Simulators, learning journeys and career prospects related to the industries.
