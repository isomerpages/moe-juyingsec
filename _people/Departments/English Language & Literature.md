**EL Intensive Programme (Graduating classes)**<br>
This programme is intended to equip our students with specific examination skills to prepare them for the GCE ‘O’ and ‘N’ level examinations during term time and school holidays. Through this programme, our students are more confident and motivated to do well in their national examinations.

**English Enrichment and Grammar Programmes**<br>
The department also embarked on a series of topical enrichment lectures to equip graduating students with the necessary knowledge and language skills to tackle the GCE O Level examination.&nbsp; The skills were conducted both by English Language teachers and invited speakers from other departments.&nbsp; Topics ranged from education to environment.

**Offering Literature as an Elective in Secondary 3**<br>
In addition, English Department continues to offer Upper Secondary English Literature as an Elective subject for Secondary 3 Express students. The inaugural class of 10 students study&nbsp;_Hook and Eye: Stories from the Margins,_&nbsp;and&nbsp;unseen&nbsp;poetry. Students will be embarking on a new novel,&nbsp;_Kindred_, next year. Literature students understand themselves and others better in a multicultural and interconnected world by exploring the depth and breadth of the human experience through works of literature.
