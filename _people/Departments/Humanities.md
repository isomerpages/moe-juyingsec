#### **Vision**
Every JYian possess an analytical and inquisitive mindset  

#### **Mission**
To nurture JYians to be concerned global citizens who are passionate about the Humanities.  

#### **Overview**
'Every JYian possesses an analytical and inquisitive mindset’&nbsp;is the vision of the Humanities Department. This is in line with the school’s vision of a gracious community of lifelong learners with strength of character. Our JYSS Humanities Programme aims to to develop our JYians into well-informed and responsible citizens with a global perspective. The programme also encourages active engagement so that our JYians will become confident, self-directed, critical, and reflective thinkers. 

To achieve our goal, the programme develops our JYians’ competence in three areas: knowledge and understanding, skills and processes, values, and attitudes. We strongly believe in learning which extends beyond the four walls of the classroom as there is no boundary to our quest for knowledge.&nbsp;
