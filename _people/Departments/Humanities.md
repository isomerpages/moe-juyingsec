#### **Vision**
Every JYian possess an analytical and inquisitive mindset  

#### **Mission**
To nurture JYians to be concerned global citizens who are passionate about the Humanities.  

#### **Overview**
Every JYian possesses an analytical and inquisitive mindset’ is the vision of the Humanities Department. This is in line with the school’s vision of a gracious community of lifelong learners with strength of character. In building a community of gracious and lifelong learners, we envision to develop all JYians into well-informed and responsible citizens with a global perspective. We work towards engaging students actively to develop them into confident, self-directed, critical and reflective thinkers. In order to achieve these aims, it is important that students develop competence in three areas: knowledge and understanding, skills and processes, values and attitudes. We strongly believe in learning which extends beyond the four walls of the classroom and our learning journeys prove that there is no boundary to our quest for knowledge.
