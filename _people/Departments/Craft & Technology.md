#### **Overview**
We hope to prepare JYians for tomorrow’s rapidly changing world by providing them with the opportunity to think creatively and develop entrepreneurial dare. In building a community of gracious and lifelong learners, we envision all JYIANs to believe in their own abilities, thus becoming independent learners, creative thinkers and confident team players.  

This is in alignment to the school’s OYSTER philosophy in which we believe that every student can learn, and that our objective is to provide a nurturing environment for each JYIAN to develop creative, critical thinking skills so that they will be able to “shine and illuminate any organisation they may enter in the future” with these skills required of an effective artist, nutritionist or engineer.

Our C&T programme adopts the E3 approach (Excite, Engage and Enrich) in the teaching of Art, D&T and F&N through simple yet meaningful hands-on and minds-on activities. Students are excited, engaged and enriched through the experiential learning by working in both indoor and outdoor settings and incorporate their art, design and culinary skills into real life cultural events as well as participation in internal and external competitions. An example is the accompanying stop-motion animation video by 3A2.

#### **Vision**
Every JYian a self-directed learner, innovative individual and confident team player. 

#### **Mission**
To nurture an informed **awareness and appreciation** of the visual arts, cultivate an **inquiring mind** and **innovative spirit** in working with materials and tools.
