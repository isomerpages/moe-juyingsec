#### **Vision**
Every JYian A Self-Directed and Collaborative Learner Through The Use of IT.    

#### **Mission**
To build a pervasive culture of promoting effective use of ICT into the school curriculum to enhance pedagogy that engages collaboration and self-directed learning.    

#### **Overview**
The IT Department harnesses technology to provide an enriching learning experience to all JYians. We aim to promote a pervasive culture of effective use of ICT into the school curriculum to enhance pedagogy that engages collaboration and self-directed learning. In order to maximise learning moments, the following programmes are implemented:  

**IT Enrichment Programme (ITP) with PASSION Programme**

With rapid advancements in technology and demand for 21st century core competencies, the baseline ICT standard across all Singapore schools has seen continuous change.  In order to meet these required baseline ICT standards, all Juying’s Lower Secondary students undergo a ICT Enrichment Programme (ITP) which is incorporated into Juying's PASSION programme.   
  
ITP skills are embedded into the curriculum time allowing a seamless integration with other subjects.  The strategic focus of ITP is to equip students with 21st Century Skills with a strong emphasis on New Media Literacy Skills in order to develop digital fluency and digital mastery. Collaboration skills using Google Classroom suite and other online software aims to nurture digital fluency in all our students.

Through the use of technology, we hope maximise every learning opportunity by being current, student-centred and future thinking.
