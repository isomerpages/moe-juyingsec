#### **Vision**
Every JYian A Self-Directed and Collaborative Learner Through The Use of IT.&nbsp;&nbsp;  

#### **Mission**
To build a pervasive culture of promoting effective use of ICT into the school curriculum to enhance pedagogy that engages collaboration and self-directed learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;  

#### **Overview**
The IT Department harnesses technology to provide an enriching learning experience to all JYians. We aim to promote a pervasive culture of effective use of ICT into the school curriculum to enhance pedagogy that engages collaboration and self-directed learning. In order to maximise learning moments, the following programmes are implemented:&nbsp;&nbsp;

**IT Enrichment Programme (ITP) with PASSION&nbsp;Programme**

With rapid advancements in technology and demand for 21st century core competencies, the baseline ICT standard across all Singapore schools has seen continuous change.&nbsp; In order to meet these required baseline ICT standards, all Juyingâ€™s Lower Secondary students undergo a ICT Enrichment Programme (ITP) which is incorporated into Juying's PASSION programme.&nbsp;  
  
ITP skills are embedded into the curriculum time allowing a seamless integration with other subjects.&nbsp; The strategic focus of ITP is to equip students with 21st Century Skills with a strong emphasis on New Media Literacy Skills in order to develop digital fluency and digital mastery. Collaboration skills using Google Classroom suite and other online software&nbsp;aims to nurture digital fluency in all our students.

Through the use of technology, we hope maximise every learning opportunity by being current, student-centred and future thinking.
