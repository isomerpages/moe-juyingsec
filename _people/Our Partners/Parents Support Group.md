#### **Long Term Goals**
1\. To provide a platform for parents to communicate and give feedback to the school.<br>
2\. To provide an informal setting to

* Strengthen parent-child bonding,
* Build teacher-parent relationship,
* Promote friendship and establish networking among parents.

3\. To equip parents with parenting skills and knowledge and add value to JYian’s education.

#### **Overview** 
JPSG Committee recognises the importance of parents working hand in hand with the school to bring out the best in our children. We believe that in order to help our children be successful in school, parents and teachers must come together as a team. We believe that when teachers and parents are allies and teammates, our combined influence on our children is very powerful indeed.  

JPSG has always been supportive and actively involved in many school events such as the Annual Fitness Run and Teacher’s Day Celebration. In addition, parents are always ready to come forward and organise meaningful activities to foster a strong relationship between the school, families and other parents. Our annual parent-initiated activities include Family Bonding Day, Teachers’ Day Gift-making Session and sandwich-making session for the graduating students sitting for their GCE O &amp; N-Level examinations.&nbsp;

These activities send a positive message to our children that we take an interest in their education.
