### **ECHA Nomination Form**
The Ministry of Education has introduced the **Edusave Character Award (ECHA)** to enable schools to give recognition to students who are exemplary in their character, behaviour and actions. This award is also meant to support schools’ efforts to nurture students of good character and sound values as active contributors and concerned citizens of Singapore.  
  
You are invited to nominate deserving Juying Secondary School students (Singapore citizens only) for the award. Nomination criteria and the forms are available in the school General Office, and can be downloaded from our school website. A copy is attached for your reference.  
  
Please submit all completed nomination forms to the General Office or email them to [juying\_ss@moe.edu.sg](mailto:juying_ss@moe.edu.sg).
