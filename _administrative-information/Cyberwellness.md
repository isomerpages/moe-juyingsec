### **Cyberwellness**
#### **Cyber Wellness Information for Parents**
##### **Overview**
MOE uses the Cyber Wellness framework to **develop every child’s instinct to protect and empower every student to take responsibility for his own well-being in cyberspace**. The three principles, **‘Respect for Self and Others’, ‘Safe and Responsible Use’ and ‘Positive Peer Influence’** when adhered to will anchor a child’s well-being in cyberspace as he will then be able to make careful and well-considered decisions.

##### **Cyber Wellness Principles**
**(1) Respect for Self and Others**<br>
Students need to: 
*   **uphold their own dignity when online** (e.g. **share appropriate content** and **participate in only legal online activities**) 
*   **respect other people online** (e.g. **put themselves in others’ shoes, accept diverse views and opinions, give credit when using other people’s work** and seek permission where necessary, avoid sharing hurtful materials).

**(2) Safe and Responsible Use**<br>
Students need to: 
*   have an **understanding of the risks of harmful and illegal online behaviour**, and take steps to protect themselves (e.g. keep their personal information private, verify the reliability of information using various sources, take steps to avoid dangers they may encounter online). 
*   make **wise and healthy choice**s (e.g. maintain a healthy balance of their online and offline activities)  

**(3) Positive Peer Influence**<br>
Students need to: 
*   be **a positive role model online** (e.g. share healthy and positive content, harness the affordances of technology to do good for society)  
*   **advocate positive online behaviour** (e.g. stand up for their peers online, report cases of cyber bullying to a trusted adult/authority, post encouraging remarks on social media).
