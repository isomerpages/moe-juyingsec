<h4><strong>Principal's Message 2023</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Goodbye 2022 and Welcome 2023</strong></p>

<td style="width: 50%;"><p>2022 has ended. Just like the previous years, this will be a good time for us to reflect on the past year&rsquo;s highs and lows, wins and losses and to evaluate them in a way that will help improve our overall performance in this new year. Reflection gives us the closure we need for the year so that we can walk into the new year with a new mindset, insights, intentions and focus. If you are like me, just the thought of a new year is just so energizing for me and I cannot wait to blaze into the future to start thinking of what of what I want to accomplish in 2023.</p>
<p>Was 2022 better than we had planned? Yes, for sure! What about the past two years? Year 2020 was phenomenal and this including 2021 which was an equally awesome year for Juying Secondary School. We have gone through struggles, challenges, achievements and celebrations over the past 2&frac12; years and I am heartened that we stay true to our convictions and this is how we arrive at where we are, stronger than before and more united as ONE Juying family.</p></td>

<p>It does not matter whether you had a good year or a not-so-good one in 2022. I ask that all of us take a moment to pay tribute to what the year has presented to each of us. If there were challenges, ponder the tough lessons they brought us. If there were blessings, cultivate gratitude for the good fortune we have received. There will always be ups and downs in life, and it is on us to do our best to interpret and experience them in the most positive ways.</p>
<p>My mission as the Principal for Juying Sec School is to ensure that we&nbsp;<strong>continue to put our students first</strong>. We have to agree that our students must be at the&nbsp;<strong>heart of choices and decisions&nbsp;</strong>we make, as JYSS is more than just a school to our students. We are an extension of the students&rsquo; families and lives and we are a caring community where students' needs are a priority. We take pride in our&nbsp;<strong>culture of care&nbsp;</strong>and believe that&nbsp;<strong>every child is important; every child is unique; and every child can learn and achieve, regardless of ability and background.</strong></p>
<p>Our students have worked hard and excelled, sustaining a splendid all-round performance for the school. Our students have achieved Value-Added results in the GCE O and/or N level examination results since 2012, and they have also done us proud by performing reasonably well at the various competition platforms, despite disruptions and challenges from COVID in the past 2 years.</p>
<p>In the past few years, my educational philosophy has evolved and strengthened. My belief that schools should nurture the whole child and appreciate each child&rsquo;s individuality was reinforced just as my belief that teachers have an unimaginable influence over their students was. I believe that the seeds we sow and nurture today will bear fruits one day in the continued life journey of our students in their future. I count my blessings every day that my students are well taken care of by my group of dedicated staff in the school.</p>
<p>In 2023, as we continue our PASSION journey, we are committed to exercise staff and student agency to achieve our next S curve of success for the school. Working in collaboration with my staff, students and stakeholders, I hope that we will be able to create a vibrant and forward-looking school: the cradle where gracious life-long learners with strength of character are nurtured.</p>
<p>2023 will definitely be another exciting and fulfilling year for all in Juying Secondary School!</p>
<p>Together We will Succeed!</p>
