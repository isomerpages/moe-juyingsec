Juying Secondary School was founded in December 1994 with the appointment of Mrs Lee Yin Ling as its pioneer principal. With an initial Secondary One cohort on 12 June 1995, the students and teachers move into the present premises, then partially retrofitted, formerly occupied by Jurong Institute.  

During the first few years, our emphasis was on setting up working systems that were effective and clear to the staff.  At the same time, teachers strived to build up instructional programmes that cater to the students’ abilities and to add value to their academic achievements.  This was strongly supported by strict discipline and a responsive care programme. The school was officially opened by Mr Peter Chen, Senior Minister of State for Education and MP for Hong Kah GRC on 18 July 1997.

In June 1999, a building extension project gave the school additional structures of a new classroom block and an IT block of two computer laboratories and three UT resource rooms. This made it possible for the school to go single session. Juying Secondary School also went through Repairs and Repainting Programme in June 2000 and November 2004.

The school underwent the Programme for REbuilding and IMproving Existing schools (PRIME) project from December 2009 to July 2012.  Among its upgraded and modern facilities are the spectacular Dance Studio with floor to ceiling glass windows, an Indoor Sports Hall, a synthetic Soccer Field and an amphitheatre.

In 2015, the school celebrated its 20th Anniversary and in conjunction of the celebration of SG50, ex-staff from the pioneer generation were also invited to the special event.

Ms Grace Ng served as the second principal Juying Secondary School (1999 - 2004) followed by Mr Abdul Harris (2005 - 2012), Mr Seet Tiat Hee (Dec 2012 - Dec 2017) and Mdm Soh Beng Mui (Dec 2017 - present).

Juying Secondary School is now into its 27th year and is proud to make a difference in our students’ educational experience through a holistic and enriching curriculum that strives to bring out the best in every JYian.
