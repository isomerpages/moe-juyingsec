<h4><strong>School Philosophy&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&ldquo;Oysters are known for their ability to draw sediments, nutrients and algae in and over their gills to create shiny, beautiful pearls. Likewise, we wish for Juying to be our students&rsquo; oyster. We are a nurturing family for students of all abilities and backgrounds as we believe that every student is unique and every student can learn. We aspire to enhance and amplify the individual talents of all students, and develop them to be life-long learners with strength of character, such that they may, like pearls, shine and illuminate any organisation they may enter in the future.&rdquo;</em></p>
