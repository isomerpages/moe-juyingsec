#### **Vision**
Active and Gracious Netballers with Excellent Sportsmanship.

#### **Mission**
To develop a driven and committed team competent in netball skills and leadership qualities, in a caring and supportive environment.

#### **Overview**
2019 had been amazing as our Netball C division girls clinched 3rd position in Group 4 during the M1 Schools Challenge League and also made it to 2nd round in the West Zone Inter-school Championship 2019. These achievements have definitely strengthen our team’s belief that Juying Netball is a force to be reckoned with!  
  
In 2020 and 2021, National Competitions were suspended due to COVID-19 SMM but our netball girls continued on with our internal training.
