#### **Vision**
To develop a healthy and active team of sportsmen who strive to achieve excellence on and off the field.

#### **Mission**
To build team spirit and develop the qualities of good sportsmen, through competitive and friendly soccer play.

#### **Overview**
Juying Football has ceased to&nbsp;recruit new Secondary 1 members from 2021.  
  
Our Football journey in 2020 and 2021 has been filled with much anticipation for in-person trainings on the field. However, given the current climate, many of our training sessions has been on zoom, for our own safety. Nonetheless, we make the best of what we have had. Here are some things that we have embarked on during our zoom sessions and beyond.

1\. Skills based trainings as planned by our coach to hone our boys' footwork<br>
2\. Physical training sessions as planned by our leaders to maintain a high level of fitness of our players<br>
3\. Sharing session by Mr Fairoz Hassan from Albriex Nigata Football Club (Singapore)<br>
4\. Upcycling of unwanted balls by converting them into flower pots using Design Thinking Approach.

Indeed, we hope for our footballers to have the skill &amp; fitness to play, the tenacity to fight on regardless, the heart to serve and the spark to innovate.
