### **Cultural Dance**

<img src="/images/cultural%20dance%201.jpg" style="width:85%">

#### **Vision**
Inculcating values through the love of arts.

#### **Mission**
A platform to inculcate interest and strengthen character through Cultural Dance.

#### **Overview**
The Cultural Dance has been actively involved in school  performances with Chinese Contemporary Dance this year. 

This was not possible without the care and guidance from our CCA teachers-in-charge, Ms Ho Sing Ern, Ms Goh Wan Ru, Ms Guo Binglian and Ms Gan Hui Yee, as well as our instructors, Ms Teng who have led the dancers with their versatile dance skills, knowledge and choreography. 

The students develop and strengthen their understanding of the Chinese Contemporary dance skills. They are also given chances to choreograph dance moves for school performances. 

At the beginning of the year, our Cultural Dance members performed for the Chinese New Year Concert in school. During the SYF Art Presentation 2021, we achieved a Certificate of Accomplishment for our  Chinese Contemporary Dance performance. Our dancers have also performed for the National Day Celebration in school. Our Sec 3 dancers choreographed, planned, led and performed for Teacher’s Day Concert with zest and vigour! 

Our Cultural Dance bonding camp in November encouraged our students to learn more about each other, respecting their peers’ diversity in races and religion. It also provided ample opportunities for students to display their graciousness by looking out for others and embracing teamwork by sharing what they know about dance. 

Thus our CCA is definitely an established platform to support and develop our members in Juying Secondary School on character building and aesthetic talents.
