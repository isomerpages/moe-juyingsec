### **Choir**

<img src="/images/choir1.jpg" style="width:85%">

#### **Vision**
One Choir One Voice.

#### **Overview**
The Juying Choir performed passionately in the Singapore Youth Festival 2021 and was awarded the Certificate of Accomplishment. In the B-Dazzled Show Choir Competition, our strong teamwork and efforts were paid off with the Bronze Medal.   

Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic, the choir has been unable to sing face-to-face to adhere to the MOE guidelines. However, this has not stopped the choir from coming up with various virtual performances for SYF, National Day as well as Teachers Day!  
  
Through these key events where our choir members were nurtured under the supportive care of their teachers, trainers and peers - they developed their vocal and dance skills to greater heights to take on more exciting performing challenges ahead to showcase their talents to the world.
