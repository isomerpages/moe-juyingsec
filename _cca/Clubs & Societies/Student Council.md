#### **Vision**
Unyielding and Illustrious Student Leaders who Lead with Conviction.

Empowering Self and Others, Encouraging Collaboration, Empathising with Others

#### **Overview**
Juying Student Council (JYSC) develops student leaders who will uphold and embody Juying’s R2IGHT school values. As the apex of student leadership in the school, Student Councillors are the leaders of leaders, who lead the way for the student body through example. Through the exclusive training and hands-on project management, JYSC empowers our Student Councillors and other student leaders, enabling them to collaborate effectively in order to contribute to the positive school culture of JYSS.

JYSC prides itself on being wholly student-run; Student Councillors are given full autonomy in the design of student-led programmes in the school. With the guidance of the Teacher Advisors (SCTAs), the Student Councillors go through a rigorous planning process with each project, beginning with brainstorming, followed by proposal writing and culminating in a presentation to School Leaders and Teacher Advisors. 

It is our PASSION and privilege to contribute to a Positive School Culture by helping to build a Gracious Community in Juying, developing a Strong School Pride in our peers and advocating for Good Discipline within the School.

#### **Key Programmes**
Out of the numerous initiatives and events planned and implemented by JYSC, there are two that embody our mission to serve the school by being the voice of the student body and the bridge between teachers and students. These events are the annual Students’ Conversation and the Teachers & EAS’s Day. The Student Councillors will plan and execute these projects from start to finish, working with other student leaders in the school and encourage inter and intra-cohort collaboration.

**1.Students’ Conversation**<br>
Students’ Conversation is JYSC’s signature event that provides a platform to amplify our JYians’ voices. The Student Councillors hold Focused Group Discussions with student representatives from various cohorts and CCAs to hear the concerns of students on the ground. They will address these concerns by brainstorming possible solutions and presenting it to the school management. The Students’ Conversation is the event in which JYSC’s role as the voice of the student body can best be seen.

**2.Teachers’ & EAS’s Day**<br>
The Juying Student Council drives a part of School’s Gratitude Movement through the planning and execution of our school’s yearly Teachers & EAS’s Day Celebration. The Student Councillors spearhead the planning process and collaborate with various stakeholders, such as the Juying Parent Support Group, Class and CCA Leaders and School Leaders. The Student Council takes charge of planning and executing the programme, designing the gifts for the teachers, as well as engaging the rest of the school in the celebration. Through this event, JYSC represents the student body and enables them to express their gratitude to the teachers and EAS staff.
