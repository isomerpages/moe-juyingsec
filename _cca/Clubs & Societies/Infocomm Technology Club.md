#### **Overview**

The AV & IT Club provides a platform for students to acquire 21st century competencies and skills in the audio-visual, robotics, and photography domains. The club also provides students an avenue for character development through leadership training, camaraderie building and social integration.

In the Audio Visual and Public Address domain (AV/PA), students receive authentic training experiences through supporting the school’s core events and successes. Equipment orienteering, managing and troubleshooting, technical handling tests, teambuilding (Lower Secondary) and manpower management (Upper Secondary) are a few of the competencies the students will attain.   

In Robotics, students learn coding and programming of the autonomous Line Tracing robots and remote-controlled Sumobots through a series of theory and practical lessons. Computational Thinking and logic are further developed during Scratch Games programming and Python programming sessions. Secondary 1 and Secondary 2 students solve challenges during their LEGO Spike Basic and LEGO Spike Advanced modules.  Our Secondary 3 students on the other hand are exposed to Arduino programming modules.  Students also participate in various competitions at the National level such as the annual Ngee Ann Polytechnic StrITwise series of competitions and the National Science Chronicles among others.

In Photography, students are exposed to a myriad of photography and videography skills that are further honed through the curation of school and external events. Students learn to expertly wield different cameras from the DSLR range, as well as the specialised lenses that accompany these cameras. These skills are also refined during workshops like the VJC-Canon Photography Exposé VIII. Students also participate in the Our School, Our Story National competition to put their skills to the test.    

Through means of providing support for the school and participation in competitions, students are able to put into practice the school values of Respect, Responsibility, Integrity, Gratitude, Humility and Tenacity.
