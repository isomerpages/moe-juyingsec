#### **National Day Observance Ceremony**
Staying rooted as a gracious intergenerational community, Juying Secondary passionately collaborated with Nanyang  Community Club for our National Day Observance Ceremony 2020. We helped out with warmly welcoming guests and engaging them at the activity booths where our student councillors and game station masters shared important historical knowledge on famous and impactful characters like Sang Nila Utama, Mr Yusof Ishak, Mr SR Nathan, 

Mr Lee Kuan Yew and Singa, who have shaped our cosmopolitan country of today. 

Our Uniformed Group cadets in NCC (SEA) were proud flag bearers in the flag party while their comrades in NCDCC

showcased their creativity and precision in executing their fancy drill to enthrall the audience. Our performing arts students also displayed their talents with zest on stage - flashy Hip Hop dance routines by our dance club members, as well as soulful melodies belted out by our Choir members. 

It was a beautiful commemoration with our Nanyang community that evening and we hope we will have many more wonderful years of partnership to show the love we have for our dream city and country, our dear Singapore.
