### **Student Leadership**
#### **Student Leadership Development Programme**
Here at Juying, our Student Leadership Development Programme is based on the belief that every JY student leader has the courage to serve as they lead and make R2IGHT choices to positively influence others and bring about changes. We believe **_every JYian can be a values-driven leader_** and contributing citizen and we encourage our leaders to seize the opportunities available to them and strive for personal growth, so that they can **_S.H.I.N.E_** in his/ her own way.

Aligned to our belief, Juying places strong emphasis on Student Leadership and has put in place distinctive programmes to nurture the leadership potential of our students. Every student will begin their student leadership journey from Secondary One through self-leadership modules integrated into the school’s CCE.  

Using a **STEER** approach, students with leadership potential and readiness are identified, and given opportunities to develop their leadership competencies. Our signature programs include the Annual LEAD Program to enable potential CCA Leaders to transit well into their leadership roles.

Throughout the year, we equip student leaders with relevant knowledge and skills, and provide them with opportunities to apply them in authentic settings and make positive contributions to their community and beyond. Opportunities like organising class-based or school-wide events, initiating and planning service learning projects and leading PASSION modules and campaigns help student leaders sharpen their leadership competencies and be a gracious citizen with a strength of character.   

Recognising that our environment gets more volatile, uncertain, complex, ambigious and disruptive (VUCAD), in particular with Covid-19, we want to help our student leaders navigate and overcome the challenges they face by tapping on their strengths and leverage the strengths of others. Intentional touchpoints were organized to allow leaders come together to support one another and brainstormed ideas together.   

Through our whole-school approach, Juying Student Leadership works closely with other stakeholders and partners, with the aim to impart and nurture in our student leaders competencies that will help them be unyielding and illustrious individuals who lead with conviction for life. These competencies include:

(i) Self-awareness<br>
(ii) Strong Communication and Influencing skills<br>
(iii) Growth Mindset<br>
(iv) Critical Thinking and Sound Decision-making<br>
(v) Graciousness and Others-oriented<br>
(vi) Creative Thinking and Innovativeness<br>
(vii) Ability to Coach/ Mentor others
