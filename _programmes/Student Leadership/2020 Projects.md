### **Student Leadership**
#### **Legacy Projects by the Juying Secondary Student Council (JYSC)**
The inaugural legacy project was launched in January 2020, titled ‘Delivering Kindness’. These student-led initiatives included hosting the Chinese New Year Appreciation Lunch for janitors, desiging gratitude cards, distributing &nbsp;&nbsp;oranges to JYians as well as care fruit baskets and snacks for staff and janitors.

After the Circuit Breaker, the JYSC welcomed the school back with collaterals produced with the new skills our SCs picked up during the full home-based learning period. They designed and put together ‘Back To School’ video clip, posters as well as our very own ‘Uniquely JYian’ Whatsapp Stickers Pack.

Besides developing collaterals, the JYSC also partnered with the Class Committee to design class bonding games led by them, while maintaining safe distancing. The JYSC in collaboration with the CCA leaders also participated in Kindness Day by turning Singapore bright and yellow on social media.

Despite the challenges brought forth by the Covid-19, the student leaders rose up to the occasion and brave through the storms with an innovative mindset.
