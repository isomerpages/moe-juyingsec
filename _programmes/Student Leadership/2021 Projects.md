The month of August had our Class Chairpersons, Sports Champions and Sports and Dance CCA Leaders especially busy. From putting together the inspiration corner, to leading their classes in JYians Mass Dance practices, and to encouraging their classes to actively participate in Juying Steps Challenge, it was a positive learning experience for our student leaders, as they enable greater cohesion among peers and contributed to a more positive class culture!
