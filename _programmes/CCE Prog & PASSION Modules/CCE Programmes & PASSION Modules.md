#### **4. Passion Modules 2020**
The school has created an integrated CCE curriculum (piloted with the Secondary One cohort in 2019) that allows students from mixed tracks to work together on a passion module of their choice per semester. The PASSION Modules include Personal Well-being, Arts, Sports, STEM, Internal Security, Outreach and Nature. This curriculum serves as a vehicle to hone 21st century competencies as well as drive passion, kindness, gratitude, intrinsic motivation, peer relation and citizenry engagement of students. The PASSION modules offered to students seek to challenge JYians to be concerned citizens and active contributors by engaging them in deep conversations in current affairs, experiential and authentic learning as well as giving them opportunities to advocate kindness for a good cause. The students embark on an investigative journey that leads to a spark for a concern before they take action to make a difference to a social / global issue. Industrial and community partners have been roped in to deepen students’ knowledge, skills, values and attitudes in the area of passion through authentic and experiential learning. Thus, this exposure enhances the Education and Career Guidance (ECG) exploration and exposure of the JYians. Opportunities are created for students to share their learning with an audience made up of primary schools, partners, visitors, schoolmates, teachers and parents during SPARK! Day held at the end of the year. The PASSION modules are also part of the Gratitude and Kindness Movement in collaboration with Singapore Kindness Movement.
