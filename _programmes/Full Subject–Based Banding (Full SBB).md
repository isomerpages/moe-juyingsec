#### **Subject-based Banding**
Subject-Based Banding (SBB) allows students of the Normal Academic and Normal Technical stream to take up subjects of varying difficulty levels that are suited to their pace of learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  
If your child/ward is eligible to take a subject at a higher academic level, you will be informed by your child/ward’s form teacher and receive a notification via Parents Gateway (PG).  
  
You will need to accept or reject the SBB offer via PG. Please take note that you only need to indicate a response for subjects that your child/ward is eligible for.
  


#### **Full Subject-Based Banding**
Juying Secondary School is one of secondary schools which will implement Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) from 2022.

#### **Purpose of Full SBB**
With Full SBB, we are moving towards one secondary education, with many subject bands, to better meet our students’ learning needs. This is part of the broader shift in our education system to recognise the strengths and interests of our children, to help them build their confidence and develop an intrinsic motivation to learn for life.

By 2024, secondary schools will have implemented the following aspects of Full SBB:
*   Offering of Humanities subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary 2; and
*   Mixed form classes with the provision of a common curriculum.

**Full SBB in Juying Secondary School in 2022**

| Aspect of Full SBB | How will this aspect be implemented? |
|---|---|
| Offering of Humanities subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary 2 | Our school will provide Secondary 2 students the opportunity to take Humanities subjects at a more demanding level, if they meet subject-specific criteria.<br>This is applicable to students who are in the Secondary 2 Normal (Academic) course from 2022, and students who are in the Normal (Technical) course from 2023.<br> <br>Eligible students from the 2021 Secondary 1 Normal (Academic) cohort who are promoted to the same course in 2022 will be able to offer Geography or History at a more demanding level. With this increased flexibility in customising our students’ learning experiences, we are able to better recognise their strengths and nurture their intrinsic motivation to learn.<br> <br>Students who wish to be considered to offer Geography and/or History at a more demanding level will have to meet subject-specific criteria in Secondary 1. They should also possess positive attitude towards learning and strong commitment to offer the subject at a more demanding level.<br><br>Upon accepting the offer, students will need to commit to the higher-level subject until the end of Secondary 2, after which eligibility for the subject will be reviewed for Secondary 3. <br>  |
| Mixed form classes with the provision of a common curriculum | As part of the pilot, our school will implement mixed form classes at Secondary 1.<br> <br>This is applicable to Secondary 1 students entering our school in 2022.<br> <br>The 2022 cohort of Secondary 1 students will be grouped in mixed form classes, comprising students from different courses of study. Students will attend lessons in the form classes for the following subjects: Character and Citizenship Education, Music, Physical Education, Art, Design &amp; Technology, as well as Food and Consumer Education.<br> <br>For the academic subjects, namely English, Mother Tongue Language, Mathematics, Science, and Humanities, students will be attending lessons at the respective Normal (Technical), Normal (Academic) or Express level. <br><br>The common learning experience through the mixed form classes creates a valuable setting for students to mingle, build meaningful friendships, and appreciate different perspectives. It can also help reduce the inadvertent labelling associated with streaming. |
