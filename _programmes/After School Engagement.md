#### **Objective**
To meet the Social Emotional (SE) needs of students by creating an environment for students to build social skills through interaction with peers and teachers through activities.  

#### **Overview**
As part of Juying's After School Programme, all JYians are welcomed to visit the newly renovated Chillax to spend their afternoon among friends. Chillax is the ‘happening’ location in school where students meet to socialise, plan activities together and make good use of their available time after school. The room is designed with the school's theme of "Vibrancy in Diversity" in mind.  
  

With a diverse selection of resources which includes PS5 and Xbox Game consoles, 2 full racing rigs with 85" HD TV, pool tables and lots more, Chillax is the vibrant place where students and staff can come together to chill and relax in a conducive and safe environment after school.&nbsp;  
  
JYians can certainly look forward to another fantastic year at Chillax as more exciting activities &amp; programmes have been planned and lined up for them!
