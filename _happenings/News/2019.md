A male teacher who spent extra time to coach his students, even going to the extent of cleaning up a student's room during a home visit, has won the LEAP Award. 

The Assistant Year Head (Sec 1) of Juying Secondary School, **Mr Roy Lee**, has been teaching for four years. As a mother tongue teacher, he has used ICT, films and other methods to engage his students in Chinese learning. 

Other than teaching Chinese, Mr Roy Lee has been spending time checking his students' work after school and conducting home visits, even going to the extent of cleaning up their room. 

"Some might think that completing assignments, preparing stationery, maintaining a room's cleanliness is our students' duty. However, some of our students lack such a routine due to a variety of reasons, including family circumstances. I want to teach them to build this routine, so that they can create a positive learning environment for themselves." 

The Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuay has organised a Teachers' Day Appreciation Dinner for six of its subsidiary schools. On this event, the 8th LEAP Award Presentation was also held. A total of 10 educators have been chosen based on 848 nominations.
