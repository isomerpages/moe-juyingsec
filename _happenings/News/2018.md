Juying's Malay Language teacher and soccer veteran, **Mr Sies Senan** was recently featured in  Berita Harian for his key involvement in a charity soccer event.

Outside the classroom, Mr Sies, a former Singapore National player, has been actively engaging the community through charity events to help those in need. Indeed Mr Sies is an exemplary role model for our students and fellow Singaporeans alike.  
  
Our highest respects for Mr Sies, the organisers, players and to those who had contributed to the success of this event.
