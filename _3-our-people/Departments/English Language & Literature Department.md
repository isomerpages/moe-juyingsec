<h4><strong>English Language &amp; Literature Department</strong></h4>
<h3></h3>
<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>Every JYian an effective communicator using Standard English.</p>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>To achieve value-added results by equipping JYians with lifelong learning
skills and values.</p>
<h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
<p><strong>In the English Language &amp; Literature department, our teachers aim:</strong>
</p>
<p>1. To develop JYians into confident and competent communicators
<br>2. To develop a strong reading culture amongst JYians
<br>3. To achieve value – added results in English Language</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration with ALP</strong>
<br>Together with ALP, the English Language Department has embarked on a school-wide
public speaking programme. These public speaking platforms aim to develop
every JYian into confident and competent speakers of the English language.&nbsp;
More details are available on the&nbsp;<a href="/programmes/alp-public-speaking" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Applied Learning Programme (ALP) webpage</a>.</p>
<p><strong>EL Reading Programme and English Language Week</strong>
<br>The department has continued to encourage students to read to help them
develop their general knowledge and instil good reading habits by subscribing
to various magazines and providing in-house reading material monthly.</p>
<p>English Language Week is aimed to encourage students to develop a love
for reading and writing. Fun and engaging activities are carried out during
the week, such as the Great Riddle, Two-Liner Stories and Essay Writing,
exposing students to different kinds of competitions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Students
are also given an opportunity to discuss and share their favourite novels
in assigned&nbsp;genres and present them as characters on Book Character
Day.</p>
<p><strong>EL Intensive Programme (Graduating classes)</strong>
<br>This programme is intended to equip our students with specific examination
skills to prepare them for the GCE ‘O’ and ‘N’ level examinations during
term time and school holidays. Through this programme, our students are
more confident and motivated to do well in their national examinations.</p>
<p><strong>English Enrichment and Grammar Programmes</strong>
<br>The department also embarked on a series of topical enrichment lectures
to equip graduating students with the necessary knowledge and language
skills to tackle the GCE O Level examination.&nbsp; The skills were conducted
both by English Language teachers and invited speakers from other departments.&nbsp;
Topics ranged from education to environment.</p>
<p><strong>Offering Literature as an Elective in Secondary 3</strong>
<br>In addition, English Department continues to offer Upper Secondary English
Literature as an Elective subject for Secondary 3 Express students. The
inaugural class of 10 students study&nbsp;<em>Hook and Eye: Stories from the Margins,</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;unseen&nbsp;poetry.
Students will be embarking on a new novel,&nbsp;<em>Kindred</em>, next
year. Literature students understand themselves and others better in a
multicultural and interconnected world by exploring the depth and breadth
of the human experience through works of literature.</p>
