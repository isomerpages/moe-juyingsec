<h4><strong>Information for Character Education Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p>The Character Education (CE) Formal Curriculum that comprises the CCE
Lessons, School-based CCE and CCE Guidance Modules (Sexuality Education
(SE), Cyber wellness (CW), Education and Career Guidance), is revised and
designed based on the 6 CCE domains – self, family, school, community,
nation and world, CCE Learning Outcomes, social trends and student developmental
needs surfaced by the school’s Character Excellence Committee. The CE curriculum
with a specific learning intent for each level has the characteristics
of sequence where learning is cumulative and continuous, continuity where
there is progression of values, attitudes, knowledge and skills at increased
depth and complexity over the length of curriculum and transferability
where students are able to put their learning into actions for internationalisation
of values and skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The learning intents for the 4/5 levels are as follows:</p>
<p>Secondary One –&nbsp;<em>Self-Mastery</em>
<br>Secondary Two –&nbsp;<em>Relationship Mastery</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>Secondary Three –&nbsp;<em>Leadership Skills</em>
<br>Secondary Four and Five –&nbsp;<em>Pursuing Excellence</em>
</p>
<p>The learning intent of Self-Mastery is chosen for the Secondary One as
they need to be aware of their identity – their strengths and weaknesses,
to face the transition from Primary Six to Secondary One, being in new
environment and handling new demands and challenges for adolescents. The
Secondary Two, having settled in secondary school for a year, will need
the skills to engage and relate to others, which include their peers, teachers
and parents, and through it, they will learn more of themselves and the
value of empathy. The Secondary Three who will take up leadership positions
in their respective CCAs will need the leadership skills to lead and inspire
their peers and juniors. Lastly, the Secondary Four and Five will stay
focused in pursuing excellence in both aspects of academic and character
development, which will definitely translate into excellent results in
their national examinations.</p>
<p>The learning intents are achieved through the teaching of school R2IGHT
values – Respect, Responsibility, Integrity, Graciousness, Humility and
Teamwork, CE knowledge, skills and competencies in a consolidated way via
different school programmes – both academic and non-academic. The CE Committee,
which is formed by the Heads of Department and Subject Heads of all co-curriculum
(PCCG/CCE, PE/CCA/Outdoor Education, Aesthetics, Student Development, National
Education-Values-in-Action (NE-VIA), Normal Technical), Senior Teacher
of Student Development, Year Heads, House Masters and the Prefect Master,
works collaboratively and integrate the CE programmes, ensuring that there
is no duplication of CE lessons. All CE lessons are guided by the structure
of CCE 3 Big Ideas of Identity (who they are), Relationship (how they relate
to self and others) and Choices (the ability to make good choices).</p>
<h4><strong>Assembly Programme</strong></h4>
<p>The Assembly Programme on alternate weeks is another CCE school-based
programme,. It is planned and organised by the CE Committee with the aim
to deliberate the school R2IGHT values and serve as platforms for students’
experience in the school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) and Learning
for Life Programme (LLP).</p>
<h4><strong>Financial Assistance Scheme</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Support for Students who need Financial Assistance</strong>
<br>The goal of the FAS Committee is to identify students with special financial
circumstances that may confine their holistic development and growth in
JYSS. Throughout the year, the FAS Committee works together with the staff
to identify and nominate students to receive suitable scholarships and
bursaries generously given by various organisations.</p>
<p><strong>Reading Books Presentation</strong>
<br>Selected students also received a set of English reading books to assist
them in their learning of the English Language. Together with teachers
from the English Language department, suitable reading books were selected
for students according to their language abilities and interests. In addition,
all students received the motivational book, ‘The Joys and Pains of Growing
Up… 17 Principles Every Youth Must Know!’ by Mr Peter Lau, a successful
ex-JYian who was the world’s youngest Neuro-Semantics® Trainer in 2007
and motivational speaker.</p>
<p><strong>CDAC and Mendaki Tuition Programme</strong>
<br>In alignment with the school’s focus on academic excellence, the school
sought the help of teacher-volunteers from the CDAC and Mendaki tuition
programme for our JYians in their learning of the core subjects. A total
of 95 students across levels and ethnic groups benefitted from these weekly
tuition sessions, allowing them additional assistance in their understanding
of the concepts in their English, Mathematics and Science subjects. This
was a significant step for our students who faced financial constraints
but yet required additional assistance in their studies.</p>
<h4><strong>Creating Opportunities for the Pursuit of Excellence Series (C.O.P.E.s)</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Objectives of Event</strong>
</p>
<p>The workshops are planned to assist the upper secondary students to:</p>
<p>1. achieve the school ‘s Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) level
learning outcomes that is ‘&nbsp;students will be pursuing excellence for
their national examinations, post-secondary education and future endeavours
in the globalised world’.</p>
<p>2. attain the CCE skills of reflective thinking, perspective taking and
responsible decision making.</p>
<p>3. practice the values of resilience and responsibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The C.O.P.E. series of workshop is customized for the Upper Secondary
Students in 2015 Term 1. The students of the graduating classes namely
the Secondary Four Express, Secondary Four Normal (Academic), Secondary
Four Normal (Technical) and the Secondary Five Normal (Academic), will
attend a total of 5 sessions workshop. The Secondary Three students will
be attending the C.O.P.E series of workshop in 2015 Terms 2 and 4. In these
workshops, the students learnt that it is possible to turn our own imperfect
circumstances, insecurities and weaknesses into a source of strength and
to overcome adversity. They learnt that being successful is about self-actualization,
being able to achieve personal growth and live a fulfilling and purposeful
life in accordance with our personal values and aspirations. The students
explore, clarify and strengthen their personal motivations for wanting
to be successful. The students were also taught good learning skills, techniques
and habits that will enhance their long-term learning effectiveness and
academic performance.</p>

<h4><strong>Positive School Climate (PSC) Awards</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Objective</strong>
<br>To give recognition to students for exhibiting the R2IGHT values.</p>
<p>The Juying Secondary Positive School Climate (PSC) awards are a set of
awards that give recognition to our students for exhibiting the school
R2IGHT values. A total of 23 students, who represented their respective
classes, were presented the Most Proactive Student awards this year in
Term Two. They exemplified the ideal student in Juying Secondary through
their actions within and out of the classroom, such as following up with
their classmates who were absent from class. To recognise the collective
efforts of classes that contributed to the overall positive school culture,
the Most Proactive Class awards were also given to each level. It has truly
been an encouraging year to see our JYians living out the school values!</p>

<h4><strong>Student-led Parent Teacher Conference</strong></h4>
<p>The Student-led Parent Teacher Conference takes on a different approach
from the conventional biannual parent teacher conference.&nbsp;In a Student-led
Parent Teacher Conference, students are empowered to take ownership of
their learning. Prior to the conference, students set academic and character
goals. They gather feedback from subject teachers on ways to improve academically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the guidance of their form teachers, students prepare their presentation
and share these goals and achievements with their parents. In this way,
the ownership of learning is transferred to the students. As they share,
they build confidence and take responsibility in their learning.</p>
