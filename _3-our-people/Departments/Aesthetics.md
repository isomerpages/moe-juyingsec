<h4><strong>Aesthetics Department</strong></h4>
<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>Every JYian An Artist Within</p>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>Developing Creative, Appreciative and Passionate Learners through Aesthetics</p>
<h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
<p>In Juying, we believe that at the heart of every JYian is an Artist. Our
Total Arts Curriculum (TAC) is designed to nurture and polish the artists
in our students. The school’s TAC takes the <strong>5Es</strong> approach
to <strong>Engage, Excite, Explore, Enrich and Empower</strong> all our JYians.
Our TAC has a robust, holistic and tiered structure that engages our students
at multiple levels.</p>
<p>Our Tier 1 broad-based Arts education is a whole school approach that
caters to all students. It comprises the Art and Music curriculum and showcases,
Aesthetics assemblies and learning journeys, as well as JYians Got Talent
festival. Additionally, students get exposure to learning and appreciating
art during their cohort-wide class bonding activities, the Mother Tongue
Fortnight Programme, and CCE assemblies and excursions.</p>
<p>We have more targeted and deeper Tier 2 Arts training for interested students,
and enhanced exposure for selected students who have the talent and passion,
through our Visual and Performing Art CCAs, PASSION modules and VIA projects,
and SPARK! Day &amp; Student-Initiated Learning (SIL) showcases.</p>
<p>Some of our key Aesthetics Partnership Programmes include the Lions International
Peace Poster Contest, Singapore Organ Transplant Unit Live On Design Competition
and One Heart for Singapore &amp; National Day Parade Exhibition, for our
lower Secondary Art students and Art &amp; Crafts Club members to get involved.
It is delightful that annually, our JYians have won awards at these national
and international Art competitions.</p>
<p>We strive to create an authentic, values-driven, student-centred and inquiry-based
aesthetics education in our classrooms; to allow our JYians to experience
the joy of learning art and see the meaningfulness of the art discipline.
Through the 4-5 years of Arts education in Juying, we develop essential
learning dispositions in all our JYians – to become creative, appreciative
and passionate learners through the inculcation of the Arts.</p>
