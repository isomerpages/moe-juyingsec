<p><strong>EL Intensive Programme (Graduating classes)</strong>
<br>This programme is intended to equip our students with specific examination
skills to prepare them for the GCE ‘O’ and ‘N’ level examinations during
term time and school holidays. Through this programme, our students are
more confident and motivated to do well in their national examinations.</p>
<p><strong>English Enrichment and Grammar Programmes</strong>
<br>The department also embarked on a series of topical enrichment lectures
to equip graduating students with the necessary knowledge and language
skills to tackle the GCE O Level examination.&nbsp; The skills were conducted
both by English Language teachers and invited speakers from other departments.&nbsp;
Topics ranged from education to environment.</p>
<p><strong>Offering Literature as an Elective in Secondary 3</strong>
<br>In addition, English Department continues to offer Upper Secondary English
Literature as an Elective subject for Secondary 3 Express students. The
inaugural class of 10 students study&nbsp;<em>Hook and Eye: Stories from the Margins,</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;unseen&nbsp;poetry.
Students will be embarking on a new novel,&nbsp;<em>Kindred</em>, next
year. Literature students understand themselves and others better in a
multicultural and interconnected world by exploring the depth and breadth
of the human experience through works of literature.</p>
