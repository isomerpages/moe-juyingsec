<h3>Humanities Department</h3>
<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>Every JYian possesses an analytical and inquisitive mindset</p>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>To nurture JYians to be concerned global citizens who are passionate about
the Humanities.</p>
<h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
<p>The Juying Humanities Department aims to nurture every JYian with an analytical
and inquisitive mindset, aligning with our school’s vision of cultivating
a gracious community of lifelong learners with strength of character. Through
the Humanities, we hope to empower JYians to become well-informed, responsible
citizens with a global perspective, equipped to navigate an increasingly
complex world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We believe in cultivating students who are confident, self-directed, critical,
and reflective thinkers. To achieve this, we focus on three key areas:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Knowledge &amp; Understanding – Building a strong foundation in historical,
geographical, and societal perspectives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Skills &amp; Processes – Developing critical thinking, research, inquiry,
and communication skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Values &amp; Attitudes – Fostering empathy, ethical reasoning, and responsible
citizenship.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Learning in Humanities extends beyond the classroom, as we believe that
education has no boundaries. Through immersive learning journeys and experiential
activities, we inspire students to engage with real-world issues and deepen
their appreciation for the complexities of society.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Together, we create a vibrant learning environment that encourages curiosity,
reflection, and a lifelong passion for understanding the world around us.

<p>As part of JYSS Humanities Program, our learning Journeys are specially
designed to provide JYians with immersive, hands-on experiences to deepen
their understanding of historical, geographical and social concepts. Through
visits to significant sites, guided tours, and interactive exhibits, our
JYians can connect classroom knowledge to real-world contexts. These journeys
foster critical thinking, cultural appreciation, and a greater awareness
of societal development and national issues, enriching their overall educational
experience. Here are the some of the Learning Journeys our JYians embarked.</p>
