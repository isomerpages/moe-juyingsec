<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>To create an environment where students Learn in an Inclusive Values Environment
(L.I.V.E.) and develop a Lifelong Investment in Fitness and Exercise (L.I.F.E.)</p>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>To deliver quality PE lessons that help to build strength of character
and equip students with Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes to pursue and enjoy
a physically active lifestyle.</p>
<h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
<p>The PE department engages students in learning about sports using the
game concept and the sports education model. Students work together in
collaborative learning groups to develop lifelong skills of problem solving,
valuing teamwork, setting goals and maintaining accountability.</p>
<p>The Sports education model involves game seasons. Students work as members
of a team for the duration of a game season and compete in a culminating
interclass game. Besides being a player, students take on additional roles
as team captain, equipment manager, fitness manager, cheerleader and statistician.
The pedagogical model drives a positive sporting experience as students
learn the values of commitment, loyalty, perseverance and leadership.</p>
<h4><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<p><strong><u>Sports Champions<br></u></strong>Sports Champions Programme
is a leadership development programme to encourage students to serve the
school community through sports. In this programme, students will be given
the opportunity to develop qualities of leadership and responsibility and
demonstrate organisational ability and decision-making skills. Sports Champions
are role models; helping others achieve their potential, helping their
communities get fit and lead healthy lifestyles.</p>
<p><strong><u>Sports Carnival<br></u></strong>Sports Carnival aims to excite
through engaging students in different sporting activities and provides
opportunities for students to lead in promoting a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p><strong><u>Interclass Games<br></u></strong>The interclass games are a
culminating activity for the PE modules. Students compete and perform officiating
duties for the games. Learning becomes meaningful and relevant and this
brings about high motivation levels and student enjoyment.</p>
<p><strong><u>Annual School Cross Country<br></u></strong>The annual cross
country fosters camaraderie and team spirit. This event encourages students
and staff to adopt an active and healthy lifestyle. It also promotes a
vibrant sporting culture for the school.</p>
<p><strong><u>Cohort Camp<br></u></strong>Cohort camps are part of the National
Outdoor Adventure Education Master Plan which the Ministry of Education
(MOE) has put in place to strengthen the holistic development of all our
students.</p>
<p>The secondary 2 camp is a 3-day residential course. The programme seeks
to develop ruggedness, resilience, and build cohesion amongst our youths.
Students learn to be more independent and confident in their own capabilities.
Camping also strengthens bonds amongst students and teachers</p>
<p>The secondary 3 camp is an adventure camp which aims to nurture students
in leadership and resilience through experiential learning. Students join
the Outward Bound Singapore in a 5 Day 4 Night Expedition.</p>
<p><strong><u>NAPFA Test<br></u></strong>The NAPFA Test is conducted for
all secondary 2, 4 and 5 students yearly. The test encourages students
to take ownership towards maintaining good health and keep fit through
regular physical exercise.</p>
