<h4><strong>PE Department</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>To create an environment where students Learn in an Inclusive, Values-driven
Environment (L.I.V.E.) towards a Lifelong Investment in Fitness and Exercise
(L.I.F.E)</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>To deliver quality PE lessons that help to build strength of character
and equip students with Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes to pursue and enjoy
a physically active lifestyle.</p>
<h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
<p>At JYSS, the PE department crafts a curriculum based on Self-Determination
Theory. This approach aims to nurture three key elements in our students:</p>
<p>1. Autonomy
<br>2. Competency
<br>3. Relatedness</p>
<p></p>
<p>We use the Sports Education Model as our framework, offering students
authentic and enriching sports experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Students join teams for entire game seasons, culminating in exciting
interclass competitions.
<br>- Beyond playing, students take on various roles such as Team Captain,
Coach, Equipment Manager, Umpire, and Data Statistician.
<br>- Through collaborative learning groups, students develop crucial lifelong
skills including:</p>
<p>* Problem-solving
<br>* Valuing teamwork
<br>* Goal-setting
<br>* Maintaining accountability</p>
<p>
<br>This approach ensures our students not only enjoy sports but also gain
valuable life skills that extend far beyond the playing field</p>
