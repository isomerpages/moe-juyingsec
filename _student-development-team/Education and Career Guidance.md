The ECG team provides a variety of platforms to help JYians in the development of attitudes, skills and self-knowledge that will provide them with the capability to explore, understand and make informed decisions concerning their potential and prospective careers. We develop partnerships and network with other institutions and collaborated with various departments to provide JYians with educational opportunities.

Our Secondary Three Express and the Four Normal Academic cohort participated in the Advance Elective Module (AEM) by the five polytechnics. They learned to develop research and inquiry skills in various faculties and broadened the horizons of our students with regard to research and development in Singapore. They had the opportunity to experience for themselves the practice-oriented learning approaches adopted in the different polytechnics. AEMs help our students discover their strengths and interests in a variety of fields.

Our Secondary Three Normal Academic Cohort took part in the four different Elective Modules (EM), which aimed to expose them to the different career clusters that enhanced their understanding of the various post-secondary options. The EM programme has given our students practical experience, adding value to their syllabus learning outcome. The students were equipped with a heightened awareness of the career opportunities that await them should they choose those paths.

The ECG Committee also organised other activities such as ECG Lessons, Targeted Assembly Talk, Academic and Career Experience (ACE), Early Admission Exercise (EAE) Comprehensive Programme, Career Talks and ECG Counselling for the students. These activities intend to provide them the awareness of the different career options in the various sectors like the Sciences, Infocomm, Media, Visual Arts, Performing Arts and Publicity.

The in-house Academic and Career Experience (ACE) for the graduating students is an interactive platform, where JYians were able to glean knowledge of the numerous courses offered by the various higher learning institutions and well as the prospects of furthering their studies beyond diplomas and ‘A’ Level.

The EAE Comprehensive Programme is a structured programme for our graduating students which provides them guidance and support throughout the entire process starting from drafting their write-ups to preparing for Interviews by equipping our students with the necessary skills and strategies.

Through the individualised guidance and support as well as the diverse platforms and exposure, the school aims to enable Jyians to make informed decisions and pursue opportunities beyond Juying so they can further develop their talent and potential.
