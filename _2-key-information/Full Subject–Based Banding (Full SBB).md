<h3>Full Subject-Based Banding</h3>
<p>Starting from the 2024 Secondary 1 cohort, the Normal (Technical), Normal
(Academic) and Express streams will be removed. Under Full Subject-Based
Banding (Full SBB), students will instead be posted to secondary schools
through Posting Groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively. As they progress through
secondary school, they will have greater flexibility to offer subjects
at different subject levels.</p>
