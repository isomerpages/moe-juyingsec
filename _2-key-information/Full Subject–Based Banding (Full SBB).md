<h3>Full Subject-Based Banding</h3>
<p><strong>Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB)</strong>&nbsp;allows students
of the G1 and G2 courses to take up subjects of varying difficulty levels
that are suited to their pace of learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If your child is eligible to take a subject at a more demanding level (MDL),</strong>&nbsp;you
will receive a notification via&nbsp;<strong>Parents Gateway (PG).</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>You will need to accept or reject the SBB offer via PG by 22 Dec 2024</strong>.
&nbsp;
<br>Please take note that you only need to indicate a response for subjects
that your child/ward is eligible for.</p>
