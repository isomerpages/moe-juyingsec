<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>School Counsellors provide support to students with personal or academic
challenges while Student Welfare Officers help students with attendance
issues to continue their schooling. Learn about the support in schools.
<br>Counselling involves providing a safe environment for students to share
their challenges and work through their social, emotional, behavioural
and mental health issues with a trained counsellor.
<br>A School Counsellor supports students by helping them learn and use strategies
to manage and cope with their emotions or situation and enables them to
make choices for positive change and development.</p>
<p>Student Welfare Support refers to the work with students with attendance
issues. These students may not attend school regularly due to their family
or home situations, lack of motivation for learning or poor peer influence.
<br>A Student Welfare Officer assesses the needs of students with poor school
attendance and works with community partners, parents and teachers to address
their needs and help them return to school.</p>
<h4>The 3 levels of counselling in schools are</h4>
<p><strong>1. Support by form teachers</strong> 
<br>Students are encouraged to talk to their form teachers who will provide
the first level of support.&nbsp;
<br>
<br><strong>2. Referral to counsellors or student welfare officers</strong> 
<br>Students who need specialised attention may be referred to a teacher-counsellor,
school counsellor while those with irregular attendance or are involved
in statutory cases are referred to student welfare officers. School counsellors
also provide early intervention for students facing social, emotional or
mental health challenges.
<br>
<br><strong>3. Referral to specialists or community agencies</strong> 
<br>Students who require more intensive intervention will be referred to our
Lead School Counsellors, Lead Student Welfare Officers&nbsp; or mental
health professionals from the multi-disciplinary Response, Early intervention,
Assessment in Community mental Health (REACH)&nbsp; or social service agencies.&nbsp;</p>
