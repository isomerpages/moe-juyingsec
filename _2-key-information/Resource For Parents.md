<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p>The 2025 O-Level results will be released soon. While we await the results,
let us also remember to celebrate their efforts, regardless of the results.
We can show support for our teens by showing them through our words and
actions that their grades do not define who they are.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Your support to your teen during this milestone is important. Use this
opportunity to have open conversations and guide them as they consider
their next steps.&nbsp;
<br>
<br><strong>Resources for Parents</strong>
<br>For resources on social and emotional support as well as education and

<p><strong>ECG Counselling Support</strong>
<br>For ECG counselling support, students may contact the ECG Counsellor in
their schools or make an ECG counselling appointment with the ECG Centre
@ MOE from 7 - 21&nbsp;January 2026 (Weekdays: 9.00 am to 5.00 pm; Saturdays:
9.00 am to 12.00 pm) through the appointment booking form at <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/moe-ecg-centre</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Collection of GCE O-Level Results</strong>
<br>All students are to return to their Secondary schools to collect their
results. Those who are unable to collect their results in person can appoint
a proxy to collect a physical copy of their results from the school. Proxies
are required to produce the relevant documents for the school’s verification
when collecting the results.</p>
