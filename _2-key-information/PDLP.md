<h4><strong>National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)</strong></h4>
<p>At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National
Digital Literacy&nbsp;Programme&nbsp;(NDLP) for our schools to help students
strengthen their digital literacy. One of the components of the NDLP is
the introduction of the&nbsp;Personalised&nbsp;Digital Learning&nbsp;Programme&nbsp;(PDLP)
for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student
will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD) by end-2021.</p>
<h4><strong>PDLP</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Every student is required to have a device for teaching and learning purposes
and is encouraged to purchase one through the school via MOE’s bulk tender.
Students are encouraged to use the device model prescribed by the school,
as the uniformity of systems and software would ensure a smooth learning
experience for everyone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At Juying Secondary School, your child will be using the PLD frequently
in class and out-of-class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The devices will be used both in and out of class for learning, to promote
active learning and greater personalisation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In class, the devices will be used to support learning of the curriculum
subjects independently or collaboratively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beyond the classroom, students will be able to use the device for home-based
learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students can review past lessons, access digital resources on the Singapore
Student Learning Space (SLS) platform and other digital platforms to enhance
their learning, or explore topics of their own personal interests using
the device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They can also make use of digital tools such as calendaring and note-taking
applications to enhance their personal productivity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It goes beyond the provision of a device but requires a shift in the way
lessons are designed and enacted to provide the learning experiences to
‘find, think, apply and create’ through the mediated use of technology.</p>
</li>
</ul>
