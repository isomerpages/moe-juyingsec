and learning needs. Students in the Posting Group 1 or 2 and being offered
subjects at a more demanding level (MDL) will be contacted by the school.</p>
<p>Please refer to the <strong><u>Full Subject Based Banding</u></strong> subpage
for more information.</p>
<p>Please note that in the event that you and your child are still considering
the MDL subjects, it is recommended that you do not purchase the books
for these subjects s until your decision has been confirmed.</p>
