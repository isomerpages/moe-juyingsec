<h4><strong>Objectives</strong></h4>
<p>Home-Based Learning (HBL) days are meant to complement, and not substitute,
in-school learning. They provide students with more opportunities to learn
independently and to be more self-directed in their learning. They will
continue to have opportunities on these days to learn with and interact
with their fellow students. Our students will thus benefit from both in-school
and home-based modes of learning.
<br>Having HBL days scheduled about twice a month for secondary school and
pre-university students represents about 10% of curriculum time in an academic
year. This is a good balance that allows students to experience HBL often
enough to develop the skills and mindsets to become more independent and
self-directed learners, without unduly compromising the in-person learning
experience in schools.</p>
<h4><strong>Information For Parents</strong></h4>
<p>Information on home based learning days will be sent through Parents'
Gateway at the start of the semester.</p>
