<h3><br><strong>Goodbye 2024 and Welcome 2025</strong></h3>
<p>Dear Parents
<br>As we step into 2025, we are navigating a world marked by rapid change
and complexity. Circumstances continue to evolve unpredictably, requiring
us to adapt quickly and creatively. While VUCA (Volatility, Uncertainty,
Complexity, Ambiguity) once captured the essence of such times, today’s
challenges are better reflected by BANI—a world that is Brittle, Anxious,
Nonlinear, and Incomprehensible.</p>
<p>In a brittle world, trusted systems can falter under strain, as seen in
global supply chain disruptions and climate challenges. Anxiety stems from
our fast-paced, hyperconnected reality, where uncertainty about the future
looms large. Nonlinearity shows how small events can trigger vast, unexpected
impacts, from geopolitical shifts to breakthroughs in artificial intelligence
(AI). Finally, incomprehensibility reflects the growing difficulty of making
sense of our ever-evolving world, especially for small nations like Singapore.</p>
<p>In such a world, our children need more than academic excellence. They
need empathy to navigate the anxiety and uncertainty around them. They
need curiosity to remain open to learning and understanding in a non-linear
environment. And they need resilience and adaptability to face incomprehensible
challenges with confidence. At Juying Secondary School, we recognise these
and have made it our mission to equip students with these essential qualities.
Through programme like PASSION and our thoughtfully crafted Subject Curriculum
and CCE experiences, we focus not just on knowledge acquisition but on
nurturing 21st-century competencies and mindset like inventive thinking,
communication, and intellectual agility. We aim to prepare our students
not only for their immediate future but for the decades of growth, change,
and opportunities that lie ahead.</p>
<p>This vision is only possible through the strong partnership we share with
you, our parents and community. Your support, engagement, and collaboration
are vital in shaping an environment where our students feel empowered to
thrive. Together, we can provide them with the tools, values, and opportunities
they need to succeed in this BANI world. As we begin this new academic
year, let us work together to inspire our children to dream big, think
critically, and act with compassion. I wish everyone a fulfilling and successful
year ahead.
<br>
<br>Your partner-in-education,
<br>
<br>Mr Kyris Ang
<br>Principal</p>
