<p>History of the School
<br>Juying Secondary School (JYSS) was founded in December 1994 with the appointment
of Mrs Lee Yin Ling as its pioneer principal. With an initial Secondary
One cohort on 12 June 1995, the students and teachers moved into the present
premises, then a partially retrofitted building, formerly occupied by Jurong
Institute.
<br>
<br>During the first few years, our emphasis was on setting up working systems
that were effective and clear to the staff. At the same time, teachers
strove to build up instructional programmes that catered to the students’
abilities and to add value to their academic achievements. This was strongly
supported by strict discipline and a responsive care programme. The school
was officially opened by Mr Peter Chen, Senior Minister of State for Education
and MP for Hong Kah Group Representation Constituency (GRC), on 18 July
1997.</p>
<p>In June 1999, a building extension project gave the school additional
structures of a new classroom block and an IT block with two computer laboratories
and three IT resource rooms. This made it possible for the school to go
single session.JYSS also went through Repairs and Repainting Programme
in June 2000 and November 2004.</p>
<p>The school underwent the Programme for Rebuilding and IMproving Existing
schools (PRIME) project from December 2009 to July 2012. Among its upgraded
and modern facilities were the spectacular Dance Studio with floor-to-ceiling
glass windows, an Indoor Sports Hall, a synthetic Soccer Field and an Amphitheatre.
Our continual upgrading includes the chillax of Room and Gab and Grub (our
canteen).</p>
<p>In 2015, the school celebrated its 20th Anniversary and in conjunction
with the celebration of SG50, ex-staff from the pioneer generation was
also invited to the special event.</p>
<p>Ms Grace Ng served as the second principal of Juying Secondary School
(1999 - 2004), followed by Mr Abdul Harris (2005 - 2012), Mr Seet Tiat
Hee (Dec 2012 - Dec 2017) Mdm Soh Beng Mui (Dec 2017 - Dec 2024) and Mr
Ang Chern Kwang Kryis (from Dec 2024).</p>
<p>Juying Secondary School is now into its 30th year and is proud to make
a difference in our students’ educational experience through a holistic
and enriching curriculum that strives to bring out the best in every JYian.</p>
