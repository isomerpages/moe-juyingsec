#### **The JYian Code of Conduct**
The JYian Code of Conduct (CoC) guides students on conduct that exemplifies the school values of  R2IGHT.  Whilst the CoC provides the standards, the school rules set the boundaries of acceptable behaviour.  

As a member of the JYian Community, I shall do my utmost to uphold the school values.
