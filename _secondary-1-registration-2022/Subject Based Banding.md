### **Subject-Based Banding**
Subject-Based Banding (SBB) allows students of the Normal Academic and Normal Technical stream to take up subjects of varying difficulty levels that are suited to their pace of learning.    
  
If your child/ward is eligible to take a subject at a higher academic level, you will be informed by your child/ward’s form teacher and receive a notification via Parents Gateway (PG).  
  
You will need to accept or reject the SBB offer via PG. Please take note that you only need to indicate a response for subjects that your child/ward is eligible for.    
  
Deadline for Acceptance of SBB Offer:  **27 December 2021, 12pm**
