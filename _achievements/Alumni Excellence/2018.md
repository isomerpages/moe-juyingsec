Ex-JYian and school counsellor Sherman Mah (4T1, Class of 2017) has been awarded the **Lee Kuan Yew Award for All-Round Excellence!**  

This is an extremely prestigious award that is presented to secondary school students who have excelled in both academic and non-academic spheres, and who exemplify the qualities articulated in our desired outcomes of education.

Indeed, Sherman was a JYian who had been an excellent role model to his peers and juniors. As the Vice-Head Prefect, Sherman embodied our R3IGHT values and balanced his leadership responsibilities with his pursuit of academic excellence. With the support of his teachers, Sherman did extremely well for his 'N' level results in 2017!

In Juying Secondary, regardless of stream, all our JYians receive equal opportunities to pursue their interests and develop themselves to become confident and competent student leaders.

We are delighted that Sherman continues to remain humble and attributes his achievements to the guidance of all the wonderful teachers he had in Juying Secondary.

Well done Sherman! Continue to fly our Juying flag high and inspire many more batches of JYians!  
Our JYian, Our Pride!
