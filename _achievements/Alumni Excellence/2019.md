Another fantastic news to share about the continued great performance of our JYian Alumnus, Huang Ruijia (4E1, Class of 2016), who has scored a near perfect score for her 'A' Levels!

Ruijia was an exemplary JYian who exhibited humility, responsibility, respect, tenacity and graciousness. A helpful individual, she was not afraid to share her knowledge and help her peers. Ruijia was passionate about writing, the Humanities and the Arts.

With the support of her teachers, Ruijia did very well for her 'O' Levels and went on to Raffles Junior College and entered the RJC Humanities Programme to pursue her passion. She also continued to immerse in the Performing Arts by joining the RJC Drama Society and partook in several productions.

We are very proud of Ruijia! Remember JYians, 'Daily Effort Makes A Great Difference!'
