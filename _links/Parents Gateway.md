### **Parents Gateway**
#### **Parents Gateway Letter**
**Parents Gateway** App was officially launched by Minister for Education, Mr Ong Ye Kung, on 2 Jan 2019. As part of Singapore’s Smart Nation/Digital Government efforts, MOE has developed this App for parents to better support their children’s educational journey. The App allows schools to send updates on programmes/activities and parents to perform administrative functions such as providing consent for their children to participate in school activities. Parents are able to do so for their children who in different classes or in different schools.  

§  Type “Parents Gateway” to download the App onto your mobile phones using  ‘App Store’ (iPhones) or ‘Play Store’ (Android phones)

§  Once installed, Parents can use their SingPass accounts / SMS 2FA to gain access

First piloted in a few schools in 2017, the App is now being progressively rolled out to all schools. Additional services will be added to the Parents Gateway e.g. by the end of 2019, parents can look forward to completing travel declarations on their mobile devices, and updating their contact details.
