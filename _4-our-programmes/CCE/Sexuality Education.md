<p><strong>Moe Sexuality Education in Schools</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools aims to enable students
to understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience
as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships with others,
including those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed
and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the
importance of the family as the basic unit of society. This means encouraging
healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended
family support. The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for
the values and beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities
in Singapore on sexuality issues.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <strong>Goals</strong> of Sexuality Education are to:
<br>(a)&nbsp;Support students in managing their physiological, social and
emotional changes as they grow up and develop safe and healthy relationships.
<br>
<br>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Guide students to make wise, informed and responsible decisions
on sexuality matters.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;Help students develop a moral compass and respect for themselves
and others by having positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality
that are premised on the family as the basic unit of society.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;The <strong>Key Messages</strong> of Sexuality Education are:
<br>(a)&nbsp;Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;
<br>
<br>(b)&nbsp;Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which
are the foundation for strong families);</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society;
and</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV
and unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved
ones.</p>

for more information on the scope of Sexuality Education in the school
curriculum.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;The subjects that incorporate topics on sexuality include:
<br>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;Science
<br>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</p>
<p><strong><u>Sexuality Education Lessons</u></strong>:</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;The values and attitudes of our youth towards sexuality
are increasingly shaped by their peers, exposure to the media, popular
culture and the internet. Adolescence is a complex stage in life as the
adolescent attempts to find his or her own identity and often struggles
with new social relationships. The period of middle adolescence (generally
from 15 – 17 years old) can be a turbulent period for adolescents. The
gap between physical and emotional/cognitive maturity may result in a tendency
to act on impulse, experiment with various activities (including sexual
activities), sometimes without understanding the unpleasant consequences
that may arise from such experimentation. The need for peer acceptance
can be overwhelmingly strong and hinder one’s ability to act responsibly.&nbsp;
Given the pressures faced by the middle adolescent from within themselves
and from peers, it is important to build a strong sense of self-worth,
personal conviction and an understanding of the possible consequences of
sexual behaviour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;Through the Sexuality Education lessons, secondary students will
have the opportunity to develop a positive self-esteem, develop their character,
and expand their understanding and repertoire of skills to deal with various
issues related to sexuality, which are of prime concern at this age.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>At Juying Secondary School, the following lessons from the<br>Sexuality Education Programme will be taught in&nbsp;<u>2026</u>:</strong>

<p><strong><em><u>eTeens</u></em><u> Programme</u></strong>:</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>eTeens</em> is a programme that was developed by
Health Promotion Board, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education,
to provide Secondary 3 students with accurate information on STIs, HIV
and protection from a health perspective. With the formation of the Communicable
Diseases Agency (CDA) on 1 April 2025, the programme would now be managed
by CDA’s Training and Education Division instead of HPB. <em>eTeens</em> is
conducted in two segments – a mass talk segment and a classroom-based programme.
The desired outcome of the <em>eTeens</em> programme is that students are
empowered to make wise, informed and sensible decisions to protect themselves
from sexually transmitted infectious diseases.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students are taught skills such as decision-making,
assertiveness and negotiation to say “no” to sex and negative peer pressure.
They also learn that the impact of STIs/HIV extends beyond themselves and
involves their family, and the importance of responsible decision-making
and seeking help. Abstinence and upholding family values are the key messages.</p>
<p><strong>At Juying Secondary School, the <em>eTeens</em> programme will be implemented as follows in 2026:</strong>
