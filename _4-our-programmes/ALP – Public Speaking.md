#### **Applied Learning Programme**
**Developing Confident, Competent &amp; Empathetic Communicators**

<p>Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in oracy aims to ‘Develop Confident, Competent and Empathetic Communicators’. Our ALP has a holistic framework that focuses on the 5Es – Engage, Excite, Explore, Enrich and Empower. All our ALP activities aim to engage the heads, hearts and hands of our students, excite them and inculcate in them the joy of communicating, allow them to explore and discover their style as a speaker, enrich them by sharpening their oracy skills and empower them to advocate for positive changes, be it in school or in the community.</p>

<p>To enhance the competency of our students, annually, we organise a series of workshops for each cohort. Our secondary four and five students will go through their interview and EAE/DSA preparatory training for them to get their application write-ups and e-portfolios ready and ace their interviews. Our secondary three cohort goes through their research and presentation skills training and have hands-on experience to practise how to give an effective speech and create effective slides. This year, our secondary twos and ones went through our ALP team’s in-house ‘show and tell’ training and had the opportunity to design and deliver their speech in class during PASSION period.</p>


<p>Annually, we recruit secondary one and two students who are interested in enhancing their oracy skills into our ALP Talent Development Programme. We provide a customised training workshop to train our ALP talent pool and Juying Achievers Programme students in toastmasters, to equip them with the necessary skills to start their journey as our Juying Gardens Ambassadors with Gardens By The Bay and represent the school in upcoming national competitions. We also conduct oracy training to develop our student leaders into more confident, competent and empathetic leaders so they can perform their roles better.  


</p><p>To build our students’ confidence and empathy, we provide various authentic application opportunities, such as Juying Orator’s Trophy oracy competition, TED Talk sharing by the Talent Pool, SPARK! Day project showcase and ambassadorship opportunities. Last year, the Ministry of Education (MOE) validated the work of our ALP and invited the team to share our good practices with the other MOE ALP schools. The media also featured our ALP to highlight the programmes that we have to develop our students’ oracy dispositions this year. Moreover, our JYian Ryan Lee (4E2) from the ALP Talent Development Programme made it into the Grand Finals of the ARTiculation Prize Singapore Oracy Competition that was organised by National Gallery Singapore and Singapore Art Museum. This is a great achievement by our ALP team over the years!</p><p>

#### **ALP Tier 1**
The school's ALP Tier 1 Engage Programmes to include&nbsp;**cohort training workshops, multi-disciplinary ‘Stand &amp; Deliver’ sharing, and advocacy opportunities via CCE-PASSION projects**. Students are exposed to different oracy skills as they progress from Secondary 1 to Secondary 4/5.&nbsp;  
  
There will be opportunities for them to do their ‘Stand &amp; Deliver’ as part of the curriculum and do advocacy projects as part of their VIA, so that they can apply their oracy skills.

#### **ALP Tier 2**

The ALP Tier 2 Engage Programmes target selected groups of students such as Speech and Drama Society CCA members, student leaders and Talent Development Programme members to expose them to a comprehensive oracy programme throughout their secondary school education, where our JYians get&nbsp;**school-wide ambassadorship**&nbsp;exposure and participate in&nbsp;**nation-wide competitions**&nbsp;to sharpen their oracy competency and enhance their resume.&nbsp;

Our&nbsp;**Talent Development Programme**&nbsp;has been underway for 3 years running and interested students undergo a series of tailor-made training workshops. Upon completion, they will be able to join our ‘Juying Roving Reporters’, ‘Juying Gardens Ambassadors’, ‘Juying TED Speakers’ and ‘Juying Emcees’ groups to apply their skills and build their competencies in these roles. &nbsp;  


The school has invited media personalities to share with our students on the life as a news anchor and a television host to provide them with authentic real-world perspectives about the media industry. Some personalities include Mr Steve Chia, a news anchor with Channel NewsAsia, Mr. Timothy W. Go, a seasoned media personality who was a news anchor with Channel NewsAsia and is more recently hosting the evening programme on 938 Live, and Ms Belinda Lee, a television host who has appeared on many travel shows and documentaries with Mediacorp.

#### **ALP Tier 2+**
The Tier 2+ Engage programmes focus on a small group of students with potential and passion to provide them exposure to post-secondary options in courses and fields related to oracy. Students also get&nbsp;**external ambassadorship**&nbsp;**opportunities**&nbsp;with organisations to gather authentic field experiences and&nbsp;**spear-head advocacy projects**&nbsp;based on their interest areas.

The ALP committee continues to seek out&nbsp;**partnerships with industry practitioners**&nbsp;to provide our JYians with the link and awareness of possible career and educational options that align with their interests and tap on this essential skill of oracy.
